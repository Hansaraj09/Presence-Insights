## Key Insights
1.SickLeave % was unexpectedly high on Monday, June 13, 2022. It had a value of 3.80%, which is outside the expected range of 2.98%-3.35%.

**Possible Reasons:** The unexpectedly high SickLeave % of 3.80% recorded on Monday, June 13, 2022, warrants further investigation. Potential contributing factors could include a decreased willingness among employees to return to the office following the weekend or a localized increase in illness due to external circumstances.

2.WorkFromHome % trended up between Thursday, June 9, 2022, and Friday, June 17, 2022, with a rise of 9.07%.

**Possible Reasons:** The spike of **work from trend** among the employees may be due to the approaching weekends. Considering this trend, exploring alternative scheduling of team-building activities away from weekends might be beneficial for employee engagement and participation.
